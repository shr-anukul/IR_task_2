supporters that nationwide right to abortion had been undone but back then in sfla headquarters were in arlington virginia closest town where hawkins her husband could afford to buy a house was minutes away at first she tried commute leaving home at am returning at pm but drives became too much gas too expensive so she bought a cheap loveseat from ikea figuring she could put in hours of work over two days before driving home for a night she used a nearby golds gym for showers new couch for naps when hawkins found office was also inhabited by cockroaches she bought an eye mask started sleeping with lights on to keep them away it was terrible terrible her husband jonathan said of that period which was just two years into their marriage but kristan hawkins was relentless she had a

was also incredulous in her view she had just encountered greatest human rights atrocity of our time routine killing of preborn babies term she uses to describe foetuses so why wasnt everyone trying to stop it i remember that first day at pregnancy centre walking out saying oh my god how life going on as normal when this happening she said during an interview in may that changed everything after

number of australian children on antidepressants sedatives other drugs to manage mental disorders has skyrocketed in last decade according to a new study which also questions if doctors should be prescribing those pharmaceuticals at such elevated rates monash university researchers found prevalence of dispensing psychotropics for children adolescents aged years younger was twice as high in than in girls aged showed most dramatic increase psychotropic pharmaceuticals typically prescribed to kids with disorders like schizophrenia adhd autism depression anxiety associate professor luke grzeskowiak said one of key trends study exposed was number of children being prescribed psychotropics for first time length of time kids were staying on those drugs after beginning treatment staying on psychotropics which include antipsychotics antidepressants psychostimulants anxiolytics sedative agents for too long was potentially unsafe he said because often evidence from safety trials based on shortuse duration once we start seeing people on psychotropics for one three years were well beyond evidence that we have about what benefits potential harms might be in those situations he said

health issues in young people on rise as prescribing of medicines to support management of those conditions whether marked increases in psychotropic dispensing during covid pandemic was justified particularly to adolescent girls needed to be investigated grzeskowiak said complicating overall picture he said australias overstretched healthcare system doctors now so overburdened that their ability to closely monitor youth their suitability to remain on psychotropic pharmaceuticals diminished he feared theres concern i guess that once people started theres a reluctance to take these

been a lot talked about in terms of increase in eating disorders particularly in young girls which have coincided with pandemic but also because of social media whats being shown on social media he said it may also be that girls more likely to recognise when mental health issues present to seek support for that compared to boys it could actually represent differential impacts of pandemic on

australian medical specialists now believe that within a matter of years per cent of cancers will be curable but warn australia not ready for surge in technology that will achieve it it seems

there a financial tsunami headed our way i think we need to follow model of reserve bank economy reserve monitors financial machinations of world makes recommendations decisions accordingly we need a medical version of reserve bank to monitor developing research trials in other countries to prepare for what coming work out how to fund it it urgent prince further says government should be investigating how to tap into immunotherapy future how to reduce costs by increasing scientific involvement in area in this country prince no outlier he has significant scientific credibility he not alone in this view i have now spoken to four leading doctors researchers in australia several in united states they agreed there massive change coming urgent government action needed australia has a chance here to get in on ground floor which will help australian patients potentially make money it should not be forgotten that what a challenge to politicians public purse driven by what excellent

considered to be very healthy it produces less obesity we have now found that unlike soybean oil it does not increase susceptibility of mice to colitis sladek said james borneman a professor of microbiology plant pathology at ucr a cocorresponding author on paper an expert on gut microbiome he has collaborated at ucr with several groups on research projects including studies investigating how gut microbes prevent obese people from losing weight for current study he teamed up with deol sladek to examine gut microbes of mice that were fed a high soybean oil diet adherent invasive e coli contributes to ibd in humans fact that we find this e coli in these mice concerning he said sometimes it can be unclear how research done in mice translates to humans but in this study it fairly clear research team was also surprised to find that mice fed on a high soybean oil diet showed a reduction in gut of endocannabinoids cannabislike molecules made naturally by body to regulate a wide variety of physiological processes at same time gut showed an increase in oxylipins which oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids that regulate inflammation we previously found that oxylipins in liver correlate with obesity deol said some oxylipins have also been found to be bioactive in colitis studies bottom line of our current study that a soybean oilenriched diet similar to current american diet causes oxylipin levels to increase in gut endocannabinoid levels to decrease which consistent with ibd in humans most processed foods in us contain soybean oil perhaps explaining why many americans have more than recommended daily allowance for linoleic acid further most restaurants in us use soybean oil because it relatively inexpensive try to stay away from processed foods sladek advised when you buy oil make sure you read nutrition facts label air fryers a good option because they use very little oil researchers use olive oil for cooking salads other healthy options for cooking they said coconut oil avocado oil they cautioned that corn oil on other hand has same amount of linoleic acid as soybean oil we recommend keeping track of soybean oil in your diet to make sure you not consuming excessive linoleic acid deol said that our takehome message deol sladek borneman were joined by paul ruegger geoffrey d logan ali shawki jiang li jonathan d mitchell jacqueline yu
